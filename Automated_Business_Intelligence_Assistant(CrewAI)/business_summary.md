- **Targeted Marketing Campaigns:** Develop campaigns aimed at increasing engagement and sales from the remaining customer base. Use insights from the top customers to create appealing offers or incentives.

## 4. Identified Risks and Opportunities
### Risks:
- **Customer Concentration:** High reliance on a small number of customers can lead to revenue volatility if any major customer decreases their orders or leaves.
